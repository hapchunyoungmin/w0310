        <p>Sure! Here's a 5-line summary of Hamlet in English:

        Prince Hamlet returns to Denmark to find his father dead and his mother married to his uncle, Claudius.

        The ghost of Hamlet’s father reveals he was murdered by Claudius.
                
        Hamlet pretends to be mad while plotting his revenge.
                
        His actions lead to a tragic series of deaths, including Ophelia, Polonius, and Queen Gertrude.
                
        In the end, Hamlet kills Claudius but dies himself, leaving the throne to Fortinbras.
                
        Let me know if you want a shorter or even simpler version!</p>

        <p>Prince Hamlet returns to Denmark to discover that his father has died and his mother has hastily married his uncle, Claudius. When the ghost of his father appears and reveals that Claudius murdered him, Hamlet is driven to seek revenge. He feigns madness to uncover the truth, but his actions spiral out of control, causing the deaths of Polonius, Ophelia, and eventually his mother, Queen Gertrude. In a final duel, Hamlet kills Claudius but is fatally wounded himself. As he dies, he names Prince Fortinbras of Norway as the next ruler of Denmark. This tragic tale explores themes of revenge, madness, and the consequences of action.</p>
